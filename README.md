Download the game here: https://giovanemachado.itch.io/minijam100-work-overload-is-a-problem-probably

Drag with your mouse the tasks on the left board to your 9 workers. 

- New tasks arrive all time.

- Workers will finish tasks automatically, in some seconds. One by one. They will achieve faster results in tasks of the same type they like more, but they get bored and can change their less hated task type.

- You should not accumulate tasks on your board, or you are gonna be overloaded. (25 is the limit if you wanna know)

- You should not accumulate tasks in your co-workers, or they are gonna be overloaded too. (5 is the limit)

This was a 48h project for Game Jam Magalu! - 2022 (https://itch.io/jam/magalu), so most of the code does not has good refactoring or tests.
